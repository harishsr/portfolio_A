      <h3>Twitter clone: Ruby on Rails Tutorial</h3>
      <p>
        This app was created using the Ruby on Rails Tutorial by Michael Hartl (<a href="https://www.railstutorial.org/book/">source</a>)
      </p>
      <p>
        This app uses a custom authorization and authentication system to allow users to create accounts and log in.  It requires that they be authenticated before accessing certain pages such as the profile.  Once logged in, they can post short messages of their choosing.  Users are also able to upload pictures in their posts.  Everything is tested.
